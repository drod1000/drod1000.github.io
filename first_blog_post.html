    <p>The subject that I enjoyed learning about the most during module 1 was boolean logic and truth tables. A lot of programming deals with boolean logic and truth tables can be a good tool to use to break down complicated logic into simpler problems. It's not really necessary when dealing with simple logic such as A||B or but it is really handy whenever you encounter logic that looks more like ((A&&B)&&C)||(B&&!A).
